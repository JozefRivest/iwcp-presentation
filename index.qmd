## The Debate and Its Stakes

- Security environment has deteriorated; Trump and the threats of removing the bases has eroded confidence in the alliance; Abe's reforms (2012–2020) enacted significant policy changes — @berger1993's two conditions, and more, for antimilitarist culture erosion are now met

. . .

- **Non-constraining and erosion camp**: public opinion have never been constraining; policy changes signal the end of antimilitarist norms [@smith2019; @lind04a; @kim15; @hughes2022]
- **Constraining and resilience camp**: norms still define acceptability parameters; public opinion restrains elites [@katzenstein_okawara93; @le2021; @gustafsson20; @lind_ueki21]

- Weakening of the alliance: Trump's threats to withdraw troops undermined confidence in the alliance
- Emergence of a new threat to regional security: China's rise and North Korea's capabilities
- Mechanisms of resilience: backlash against unwanted policy [@takenaka2021], LDP-Komeito coalition dynamics [@liff2019]

## From Norms to Attitudes

- Previous research: pacifism/antimilitarism as **macro-level norms** — collective, national, homogenizing

- This paper: **individual-level attitudes** — unobservable latent variables, continuously distributed, shaped by personal experience

- This reframing reveals *heterogeneity* that norm-based approaches obscure

## Three Untested Assumptions

::: {.incremental}

  1) **Unidimensionality** — all defense/security items measure a single construct; any item is interchangeable

  2) **Equal item contribution** — all items contribute equally; any single item is a sufficient proxy

  3) **Measurement equivalence** — items measure the same construct across demographic groups, enabling valid cross-group comparisons

:::

. . .

If these fail, existing findings about pacifist change may rest on **invalid measurement**

# Data and Methods

## Data and Methods 

- **Data:** 2022 UTokyo-Asahi Survey (UTAS), n=1,014 (listwise deletion)
  - 9 items on defense, security, and legal constraints
  - Excludes items asking preference between two policy options

- **Three-stage psychometric strategy:**
  1. **EFA** — determine dimensional structure
  2. **IRT (GRM)** — examine item contribution and information
  3. **Measurement invariance + DIF** — test equivalence across gender and age cohorts

# Analyses

## Factor Structure: Two Dimensions

![](./images/parallel_plot-1.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
EFA with principal axis factoring, oblique (promax) rotation. Two-factor solution. Factors correlate at r = 0.57 — related but distinct.
PA1 = domestic capabilities dimension; PA2 = international/alliance dimension.

## Relationship Between Items and Latent Factors

```{r}
#| fig-width: 20
#| fig-height: 15
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: center

library(gridExtra)

item_names <- c(
  "Article 9", "Three Non Nuclear", "Preemptive Capabilities",
  "Alliance USA", "Futenma", "Collective SDF",
  "Change Constitution", "Defense Power", "Yasukuni"
)

plots <- list()
for (i in 1:length(item_names)) {
  plots[[i]] <- update(
    itemplot(grm.mod,
      item = i,
      type = "tracecontour",
      rotate = "promax",
      main = item_names[i]
    ),
    par.settings = list(
      layout.heights = list(top.padding = 3, bottom.padding = 3),
      layout.widths = list(left.padding = 4, right.padding = 4)
    )
  )
}

grid.arrange(grobs = plots, ncol = 3)
```

## Item Contribution to Measurement

```{r}
plot(grm.mod, type = "infotrace", which.items = 1:ncol(items2), rotate = "promax")
```

## Contribution of the test as a whole

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-height: 12
#| fig-width: 10

plot(grm.mod, type = "info", rotate = "promax", main = " ")
plot(grm.mod, type = "infocontour", rotate = "promax", main = " ")
```

## Measurement Invariance 

**Across age cohorts:**

- Full **strong invariance** holds — loadings and intercepts equivalent across generations
- Valid basis for cross-generational comparisons

. . .

**Across gender:**

- Configural and weak invariance hold
- Strong invariance **marginally fails** (p = 0.090) — factor loadings approach non-equivalence
- Item intercepts remain fully equivalent
- Cross-gender comparisons should be made with caution

## Differential Item Functioning

:::{style="font-size: 80%"}

**Gender (PA1 — domestic):**

- **Change Constitution** and **Yasukuni** flagged — women discriminate more sharply on Change Constitution (non-uniform + uniform DIF)
- Effect sizes negligible by Zumbo-Thomas / Jodoin-Gierl criteria

**Gender (PA2 — international):**

- **Article 9** and **Futenma** flagged — women more likely to oppose Futenma relocation at the same level of θ₂

**Age cohorts (PA1):**

- **Preemptive Capabilities** and **Change Constitution** — War generation opposes preemptive strike even at moderate θ₁ (lived memory vs. strategic lens); Postwar cohort requires stronger pacifist orientation
- **No DIF on PA2** — alliance and base politics function equivalently across generations

"Postwar", # 18–54, born after 1970
"Early postwar", # 55–79, born 1945–1969, grew up under Article 9
"War gen" # 80+, conscious memory of WWII

The DIF analysis identifies where exactly the biases documented by the
MI tests come from, at the item level. Even where the scale passes MI,
individual items carry group-specific biases, which is why single-item
inferences are doubly unreliable.

# Discussion

## Testing the Three Assumptions

:::{style="font-size: 90%"}

1) **Unidimensionality** — *Rejected*
    - Two dimensions: *domestic capabilities* (nuclear taboo, preemptive strike, constitutional revision, defense spending) vs. *international/alliance* (U.S. alliance, base politics)

2) **Equal item contribution** — *Rejected*
    - Items vary substantially in discrimination; Three Non-Nuclear discriminates strongly on PA1; Yasukuni, Article 9, and Collective SDF the weakest

3) **Measurement equivalence** — *Partial*
    - Full strong invariance across age cohorts; borderline across gender (p = 0.090)
    - DIF: **Change Constitution** and **Yasukuni** gender-biased on PA1; **Futenma** and **Article 9** on PA2; **Preemptive Capabilities** generationally differentiated on PA1

:::

## Implications

::: {.incremental}

- The two-dimensional structure **explains contradictory findings** in the literature: different groups may be changing on *different dimensions*
  - *Robustness tests in the supplementary materials*

- Japanese respondents can **simultaneously** support domestic defense within constitutional bounds while relying on the U.S. alliance — a nuance lost under unidimensionality

- Single-item inferences are **doubly unreliable**: they capture only one dimension and may be biased for specific groups
  - They also have unequal capacity to capture and measure the latent variables of interest

:::

# Conclusion and Limitations

## What Do We Do Now?

- A validated **multi-item scale** — accounting for dimensionality and unequal item contribution — offers a more robust basis for inference

- Be more careful about inferences made from individual items

- Future: Work on a battery of items that would provide a reliable and consistent way to measure these attitudes
  - Open-ended survey questions + LLMs to examine how people define these concepts → develop better items

## Limitations

- Cross-sectional data (2022) — a snapshot, not temporal dynamics

- Does not provide a definitive answer to whether pacifism has *changed*
  - Aldrich-McKelvey scale to estimate variation over time and correct for DIF [@hare2015]

- Dimensional structure over time remains unknown

- At most: a methodological benchmark for future longitudinal research

## DIF: Gender and Base Politics

:::{layout-ncol=2}

![](images/article9_plot.png)

![](images/futenma_plot.png)

:::

::: {.notes}
Women are consistently more likely to oppose Futenma relocation at the same
level of international antimilitarism (θ₂). One possible explanation:
individual experiences with sexual assaults near US military bases
shape women's attitudes independently of their general antimilitarist
orientation. Article 9 also shows gender DIF but the pattern is subtler.

## DIF: Generational Memory and Preemptive Strike

img1 <- image_read_pdf("images/dif_cohort_PA1.pdf", pages = 2, density = 300)
img2 <- image_read_pdf("images/dif_cohort_PA1.pdf", pages = 3, density = 300)

::: {.notes}

"Postwar", # 18–54, born after 1970
"Early postwar", # 55–79, born 1945–1969, grew up under Article 9
"War gen" # 80+, conscious memory of WWII

War generation (born before 1945) rises steeply at lower θ₁ values
— opposing preemptive strike even at moderate pacifism levels. This
reflects a near-unconditional normative commitment rooted in lived memory
of Japan's military expansion. The Postwar cohort evaluates preemptive
capabilities through a more strategic lens shaped by the US alliance
and perceived threats from North Korea and China.
